## How to collaborate

To collaborate, you must meet the following requirements:

- A git installed on your computer.

First, open a terminal and type the following command:

```bash
cd <folder>
```

where `<folder>` is the directory of your application (as used for developing in Python). After this command, back to Github and click on the green button `Clone` and copy the link that corresponds to a link ending in `.git`. Once copied, run the following command:

```bash
git clone "<link .git>"
```

where `<link .git>` is the link you copied, ending with .git. During this command, sometimes you are prompting to login to GitHub, you can enter your login credentials and after that, a new folder is created which is a repository. After this command, open the application to begin developing!

To push to this repository, run the following command:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
git push
```

where the first command is where git adds this files to be commited, a second command is where a git is commited and is ready to push to this repository with the specified message (**You must write your own message on what you'll be commited to**) and third command is where it is being pushed to GitHub repository. After three command runs, you can view the repository with new commits on Github.
